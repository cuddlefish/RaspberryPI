RaspberryPI
===========

For a site hosted on Raspberry Pi

There are two separate apps set up:

* Tornado (Python)
Using Tornado webserver (and tornado templates) because they're fast/minimalistic, and they're used some places at work (gotta learn em)

* Flask (Python)
Simple. My SD card is full, so couldn't install Django.
